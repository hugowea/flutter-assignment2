# flutter assignment 2

My app now has new features. 

Now project has  separated files for each page, main file and also for some logic features. 

First difference from previous assignment is that now page with joke demonstrates two different buttons: Next for switching a joke, and Like icon - for adding to Favorites (which changes color after clicking on it) 

Also, app has additional screen with favourite jokes - they are shown as list of cards. 
They even can be deleted (you can press on the Delete button)

To switch between pages - there is bottom navigation bar. 

One of additional features = search bar which allows to seatch for favorite jokes. 

First page - page with jokes
